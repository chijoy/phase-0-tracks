# What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linus operating system?

* Linux is open source software, is easy to use and is feature-rich.
* It assumes you know what you are doing and allows you to do anything you tell it to. Whether unintentionally bad or not. 
* It treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power. 

# What is a VPS (Virtual Private Server)? What are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a machine that acts as a private, virtual server, that runs its own operating system. It is sold by a hosting service. 

Advantages include:
* It's less expensive than a full dedicated hosting plan that uses a physical server.
* Easily scalable, and customizable.
* Technical support is provided.

For security reasons, it's a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system.
