# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? *Version control keeps an organized record of configurations to files and systems. It is useful to be able to go back in time, so to speak, and make changes or fix mistakes.*
* What is a branch and why would you use one? *A branch is an ordered list of commits. To put it simply, it creates copies of a project that can later be merged to make a final product.*
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? *A commit is a save point within a file or system. A good message is a very brief explanation of the change that was made*
* What is a merge conflict? *A merge conflict is when multiple changes were done to a single file and git does not know which change is correct.*
