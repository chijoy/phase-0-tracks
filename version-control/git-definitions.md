# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

* Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later and allows multiple people to make changes on the same code and merge it into a master. It's useful so that you can track the history of changes, as well as allow multiple changes to be made in different branches by different people. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

* A branch is an offshoot of the master and allows you to make changes without interfering with the main code, and overriding other, simultaneous changes. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

* A commit is a point in time that saves the changes you've made. A good commit message provides specific details. 

* What is a merge conflict?

* Sometimes you get merge conflicts when merging or pulling from a branch. It's content and conflicts that need to be fixed.
